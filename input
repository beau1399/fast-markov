I think the most important thing is making sure our staff sees me and has access to me. I don't have all the answers, so it's important for me to get in and visit with the staff. I know Dave has done that and certainly that is helpful from a starting point. But it's something where I've got to forge those relationships and so I think it's important for me to meet with our staff, listen to them and then pave the way forward. I'm hoping the next two days is a start - today and tomorrow. I know having spoken with our athletic staff today, they've been eight months without an athletic director. That's very hard to do. I thank them for what they did. There are a lot of great people in this department. Tomorrow will really help the healing process as it relates to our football program. I think those are two good starting points. I think really having access to me and me being visible is really important and I plan on doing that. One of the reasons I accepted the job here, and certainly it was a tough decision, but I go back to my days at Alabama, and working for Dave, and the love he felt for East##Carolina. I can't tell you how many times he talked about how hard it was for him to leave and what this place meant to he and Pam and their kids. I knew it was special and the right opportunity. I do think I will start there, but certainly engaging myself within the community will be important. I would say both. As you look at the history of the two previous institutions I was at - Alabama and Tennessee - two schools that I would say live in the land of plenty. Southern##Miss does not live in the land of plenty. So you have to do things a little different way. I would actually tell you I'm a much better athletic director today having done that, so I will use my experience from both areas to help move this program forward. I think a lot of it does start with the health and well-being of our football program. I could be saying this about any school in the country. It starts there. Now we have a lot of programs that are really important. But we need football to be healthy in order to survive financially. And I'm hoping tomorrow will help start that healing process and we can all come together. Both myself and the new coach can build you trust and confidence to move forward is what we need. I think there was a time where a training table was considered a luxury. I would tell you today they're a necessity. I do think that's an important piece. I'm not ready to put a timeline on anything, but certainly that is an important component. I am so pleased to welcome Mike Houston, his wife, Amanda and their two boys to the East##Carolina family. Mike has worked his way up the coaching ranks and has a track record of success at every program he has led. Mike made it perfectly clear to me this is the job he covets and he fully understands the tradition and prestige of Pirate football. He is a man of high integrity, a great communicator and believes in molding student-athletes on and off the field. He's going to be a great asset to our university and the Greenville community. I know he can't wait to get started and he and his staff will work tirelessly to get the Pirates back on a path to success. It's not about me, and I don't have all the answers. I tell my staff that multiple times. We have great people inside our department, and we have great people in this community, so I'm spending the first 100 days talking and listening about where we're going. We've got to invest. There are a lot of reasons we were 3-9 over the last three years. Some of that is infrastructure. I want to make sure we're building the foundation the right way to sustain success. We've got really good people in place, but we need everybody on this journey together. We can't do it by ourselves. I do think when we run out of the tunnel at the end of August in Raleigh, you will see a much different football team than you saw last year. I'm not saying how many wins that will be, but I do know you'll see a different team because of the expectations that our coaching staff will place on the team. We are not the University of Greenville. We are East##Carolina University. Being in the position that we're in athletically and the visibility, we should be engaging our entire eastern North##Carolina communities. It is important to me that we are out. We want you to be on campus to be a part of the return of East##Carolina football. Engage with us. I am around. I will be visible at our athletic events. I'm being talked into starting a Twitter account, which I've never done. I don't know if they'll be successful or not. This will be the first of many letters I will post on our website as we begin this important journey together. One of our goals as an athletics department is consistent communication. I'm also excited to use this platform to share upcoming events and the great stories taking place with our student-athletes. It has certainly been a busy time in the athletics department as we incorporate new staff and welcome back our student-athletes for the spring semester. As we forge ahead, our staff is looking at every area to see where we can improve in 2019 and years to come. It's imperative we ask ourselves very important questions. What are our strengths as a department? What areas do we need to focus on for improvements? What's in our way of comprehensive excellence? What are the next steps? Those questions are being answered each day. I have spent the first couple of weeks of 2019 visiting Pirate fans in Greenville and across several Eastern##North##Carolina communities. My schedule will include visits to Raleigh, Greensboro, the Outer Banks, Wilmington and Charlotte in the coming weeks. As we begin a new era of ECU Athletics, we will be making many decisions in an effort to stabilize and sustain forward progress. We will continue to improve upon the many successes which exist within the department and make significant changes to other areas to bring about different outcomes. You will see a renewed emphasis on fan engagement and marketing, a restructured individual and season-ticket pricing structure, the reemergence of several successful events of the past, and the beginning of new traditions such as a revamped Pirate Walk on home football weekends. I have learned this is a resilient place, and that is in no small part because of you. Pirate Nation is strong, loyal and committed to excellence. Your love for and commitment to ECU is why we will continue to thrive as we move forward. It's exciting to just see the possibilities. I want to congratulate all our student-athletes for posting a cumulative fall semester GPA of 3.0 and it's important to recognize the office of student development for their work. Congratulations are also in order for Nina Baloun, who was named director of football operations at ECU on Monday. Nina is a great addition to the football staff and has previous experience at Houston and Illinois. Speaking of football, we are working diligently to find a sixth home game. We have spoken to several schools, both FCS and FBS, but nothing has been finalized at this point. Our goal is to release our season-ticket prices in mid-February and our final non-conference opponent should be announced in the coming weeks. I hope you get an opportunity to come watch our men's and women's basketball teams at Minges Coliseum. Coach Dooley and his team just returned from a two-game road trip and it's easy to see the progress the team is making heading into the meat of the conference season. The crowd was terrific last night in Minges against a talented Temple team and we need that to be the environment the rest of the year. Just count the amount of times you have seen the Pirates on the floor diving for loose balls, taking charges, and making the unselfish play. How about that home win over Cincinnati? What a special day for those student-athletes and coaches and our fans! When you are building a program like Coach Dooley is, it's important for players to see their hard work paying off. I can't say enough about our women's basketball team and their resiliency this season. The defense has been suffocating at times, leading the conference and ranking fifth in the country in opponent turnovers per game. Coach Nicole Mealing and her staff have worked hard to keep a level of consistency within the program. The weather has been a bit chilly here in Greenville but it hasn't stopped all of our spring sports from getting their workouts in. I have observed softball head coach Courtney Oliver and her team as they began practice. The ECU Softball Stadium playing surface is under construction. I know Coach Oliver is excited about this year's team that returns a number of student-athletes from 2018. The Pirates' season-opening doubleheader is set for February 8 when they face Youngstown##State and Miami##of##Ohio on the first day of the Spartan Classic on the campus of the University##of##South##Carolina##Upstate. We have great season ticket packages available to choose from and you can do so by utilizing ECU's Online Ticket Center. If you have time this weekend, please come check out a couple of our teams in actions. Our swimming and diving programs will host a dual meet on Saturday versus UMBC at Minges Natatorium, the final home meet of the season. We will be honoring our senior student-athletes prior to the event at 12:40 PM with competition getting underway at 1 PM. Our men's tennis team begins the spring season by hosting James Madison on Sunday at noon and The Citadel at 2:30 p.m. on Monday, with both matches being played at the ECU Indoor Courts at Next Level Training Center. We are also beginning our Pirate Club renewal program. You can check out information about the Pirate Club at ecupirateclub.com. The Pirate Club is a vital part of our department and allows us to fund scholarships, build or renovate facilities, and continue to give our student-athletes a first-class experience. Now is the time for us to come together as Pirates as we continue to earn the trust of our proud fan base. Hope to see you on campus soon! Go Pirates! Following prayer and reflection, I have accepted the position as Director of Athletics at East Carolina University. This was a difficult decision and one that came with a lot of thought.  Please know that I have been feeling a deep sense of indebtedness in recent days to The University of Southern Mississippi, Dr. Rodney Bennett, athletic department staff and the Hattiesburg community.  Katie and I, along with our children, will be departing from the University community and the Department of Athletics, with some amazing blessings, powerful life lessons and countless positive experiences. It has truly been an honor to serve the Golden Eagles and the many Eagle Club members who invest in the success of student-athletes.  I wish Southern##Miss continued success in the years to come.  As we strive to provide an excellent and comprehensive student-athlete experience, I am excited to share with you how we continue to make that goal a reality.   The volleyball project is proceeding on schedule. The foundation slab has been poured and the steel structure will be erected beginning next week. The new facility will house our women's volleyball program with a seating capacity of 1,000 fans for home matches and will feature a locker room, weight room, and a satellite sports medicine space. We anticipate opening the building in July of 2019.  The pursuit of academic success is our top priority for student-athletes. The Bower Academic Center will be located on the second floor of the University library. The center will feature a comprehensive academic support experience for our student-athletes including 18,000 square feet of space complete with private and collaborative study areas, an expansive computer lab, offices for our academic support staff, and access to tutorial services. We are working closely with University leadership to finalize the start of the project and will occupy the facility in late 2019/early 2020.  We are presently working on a locker room renovation at Pete Taylor Park. On November 12, we will begin demolition of the current locker room space and remodel it with new flooring, paint, graphics, and custom designed lockers. The refurbishment will continue to advance our commitment to the student-athlete experience and enhance the competitiveness of our baseball program. Brian Morrison will be the point of contact for our efforts on this project. You can reach him at 601-266-5055 or at brian.morrison@usm.edu.    Since July 1st, we have added five Circle of Champions members. We offer our thanks and appreciation to the following individuals and organizations for investing in our student-athletes:  I am proud to report that for the second consecutive year every member of our Athletic Department staff has contributed to the I'M IN Campaign and are members of the Eagle Club. They understand that our work carries meaning and that our success begins with each of us investing in the future we all desire for Southern##Miss.   This Saturday, John Cox, Southern##Miss' Director of Sports Broadcasting, will be inducted into the M-Club Hall of Fame. In his 41st season with Southern##Miss, John is a staple within the Athletic Department. We look forward to recognizing John this weekend for his immeasurable contribution to Southern##Miss Athletics.  We will recognize service members of our armed forces with our Military Appreciation Game this Saturday at The Rock as football hosts Marshall University at 2:00 p.m. CST. Veterans of each foreign war will be honored, and we will enjoy a special flyover by representatives from Camp Shelby along with other pregame enhancements. We look forward to recognizing and honoring those who selflessly serve our nation.  Our cross country program concluded an impressive season led by Head Coach Jon Stuart and Assistant Coach Aaron Kindt. Our team has been ranked in the top-10 in the South Region throughout the season. The team finished fourth at the C-USA Championships. Three student-athletes earned All-Conference honors as a result of their performances: Junior Sandra Szpott was named All-Conference Second Team, with Sophomores Kate Mattox and Emma Kate Holdbrooks garnering Third Team selections.  The women's soccer program closed the regular season with a record of 11-5-1 overall and 5-4-1 in C-USA, earning the sixth seed in the C-USA Tournament. This is the program's first tournament berth since the 2007 season and the most overall wins since the start of the program in 1997. They defeated the third seeded UAB Blazers 1-0 on Wednesday to advance to the tournament semifinals. This is the first tournament win for the program since 1999.  We have exciting things happening at Southern##Miss Athletics! Thank you very much to those who attend our events and invest in our student-athletes. Your generosity and support is much appreciated!  In our last To##The##Top, I shared our progress with the Department's inaugural Leadership Academy. In this edition of To##The##Top, I've asked for a report from one of our Program Leaders on the capstone experience for the Academy – a 7-day wilderness experience with an organization named Outward Bound. The expedition took place on the Superior Hiking Trail in northern Minnesota. So please allow me to introduce one of our program leaders, Caroline Bevillard, and a few of her journal entries from the trip.  PS - I got roped into attending the Outward Bound experience. In short, I survived.  We recently sent our 375 Student-Athletes 'homeward bound' following our Baseball team's end-of-season on June 3rd and our Track & Field team's end-of-season on June 9th. Our Student-Athletes have spent the past school year in pursuit of Academic and Athletic achievements.  Many of our Student-Athletes are returning to their parent's homes in 25 different states. Some are off to new cities in search of work experience or travel. Other Southern##Miss Student-Athletes will be crossing oceans as they return to their homes in 24 different countries.  As our Student-Athletes return home, our professional staff and coaches are already home – in beautiful Hattiesburg and the surrounding areas. While our Student-Athletes are at home, we are all hard at work closing the year, and at the same time, planning for the return of our Student-Athletes beginning in August. We are working diligently to improve every facet of our Department – in Academic Affairs, our Business Office, in Compliance, and Development, Equipment Operations and Facilities, in Strength & Conditioning, in Sports Medicine, in the Ticket Office, and every other unit of our Department of Athletics.  As our Student-Athletes are home, they leave traces of their performance. Some of that performance is measured in Grade Point Averages and Graduation Success Rates. Other traces of their performance are measured in win/loss records and individual and team awards. Still other measures of performance have included hours of community service and fiscal expenditures. In fact, nearly every element in our Department of Athletics is measured in some way.  Yet as our Student-Athletes have headed home, our Department Leadership Team is gathering to consider how we promoted, funded, supported, and measured the leadership of our Student-Athletes. And in-turn, how we supported the educational mission of the University and the Department. How did we train our Student-Athletes to lead in alignment with our Guiding Principles of Respect, Positive Energy, Focus, Excellence, Collaboration and Honor? How have we prepared them for leadership roles once they return home to their communities with a degree in hand?  Some of this work does not yield an immediate measure of performance – which makes us all the more vigilant in our planning and reviews.  In the beginning of this past academic year, we listed a dozen top priorities for the Department and a number of related goals. These included alignment with University leadership, responsible financial models, academic achievement, and the like. One of our top priorities was a particular focus on Student-Athlete Life, and more specifically, leadership development.  As a former Student-Athlete, I understand the impact of leadership training and opportunities. I am deeply appreciative of those who designed and delivered programs to cultivate my own skills. I remain in their debt to this day.  As such, we designed and launched our inaugural Leadership Academy to develop a model for leadership development for our Student-Athletes.  Our Program Leaders included Dr. Melissa Thompson, our Director of Student-Athlete Development, Lauren Lanford, our Director of Life Skills and Career Development, and Caroline Bevillard, an Associate AD involved in all facets of Departmental planning and processes. As an aside, all three of our Program Leaders are former Student-Athletes.  Our Program Leaders were charged with the mission to develop a year-long leadership program that would provide a transformative experience, drawing Student-Athletes to develop excellence in their self-awareness, interpersonal relationships, and citizenship. Through ongoing training, service and outreach initiatives, the Academy was formed to provide programming aimed at developing Student-Athletes to become leaders and citizens of the world.  Nearly a year ago, we requested nominations from the 12 Head Coaches of our 16 Sport Programs, and after the selection process was finalized, 19 Student-Athletes were selected to engage in our first Leadership Academy.  The Academy was launched in August 2017 and consisted of monthly meetings that covered topics ranging from Growth Mindset to Servant Leadership. In addition, the Academy included 2 day-long retreats. I had the good fortune to attend those retreats, and they were a learning experience for me as well.   In conclusion, please know that the results of the Leadership Academy will pay high dividends for all involved – our Student-Athletes, their sport programs, the Department of Athletics, and our great University. But perhaps most of all, the Leadership Academy will benefit the communities and families where they live and work.  Special thanks to our Coaches, our Program Leaders, and our Student-Athletes. This inaugural Academy far exceeded our expectations, and clearly, we have established a model for our entire Athletic Department. We will do our very best to continue to refine and support the Academy and related leadership initiatives – expanding training to a broader base of our Student-Athletes. Within our Department of Athletics, leadership development is one of our top priorities, and as such, we will be accelerating and expanding our leadership development programming, on our way To##The##Top!  Footnote: As mentioned, in the next version of To##The##Top, I have asked one our Program Leaders to relate their experience in our Outward Bound adventure. Following that, we will be hearing directly from our Student-Athletes on their leadership development experiences. In short order, additional information and photos will be available on our website. As stated on my first day on campus, the Athletic Department and its teams will actively engage the community. Over the past 12 months, our entire Department of Athletics has been doing some much-needed retooling. We have been very focused and diligent in building our vision to bring sustainable excellence to our operations and infrastructure. I invite you to ask any member of our Leadership Team, Department Heads, Coaches, and our professional staff. It's been a busy time - strengthening the fundamentals of success. We are renewing our commitment to support the educational mission of our great University and educate Student-Athletes from over 24 states and 24 countries around the world. We are succeeding in the classroom with an impressive Departmental GPA of 2.94, the highest Fall GPA on record, graduating 84% of our Student-Athletes, and still striving for greater achievement. We hold competitions in 16 Sport Programs on an annual basis. We are bringing people together as a community to share in our achievements.  At the same time, we remain committed to improving our programs, our facilities, our support services, and our competitive success. We have implemented a series of programs to support Student-Athlete wellbeing including our Leadership Academy, which consists of 18 Student-Athletes from 5 Sports engaged in a year long leadership development program, and we are looking forward to taking them to the Minnesota wilderness for a week long Outward Bound capstone experience. We have made an investment in our nutrition services and education to enhance Student-Athlete performance and recovery.  Our life skills programming continues to serve our Student-Athletes with career development and financial education, Wellness##Wednesday initiatives, and other professional and personal development opportunities on a weekly basis. We continue to plan several facility improvement projects- The Rock, Reed Green Coliseum, Volleyball/Wellness Center, Beach Volleyball, M-Club - that are actively in the works. All of these will enhance the Student-Athlete experience. You are invited to be a part of our achievements. Our plans. Our vision. Our future. It is important that you know you are always welcome and are invited to become engaged with our Department of Athletics. Yet, most importantly we want you to find meaning and value as you engage with our Department. If you are a fan, we hope you find meaning in our traditions, and in rooting for the Golden Eagles. Some of our sporting events have a cost of admission, and others do not - Soccer, Tennis, Track & Field, Golf. Either way, we invite you to attend. And if you have children, we hope they will come along with you. They too are invited and may find meaning in connecting with our Student-Athletes. If you would like to support a specific area of our Department, we invite you to become an important part of our sustainable success as a member of our Eagle Club. Our belief is that you will find meaning in supporting our Student-Athletes and their continued academic, athletic and social development. You can become a vital part of our team with a donation of any amount. If you are a corporation or local business, we invite you to engage with our Department. Think about it -- the success of Southern##Miss Athletics brings a positive economic impact to our community and region. If you have the financial means, we invite you to review our Eagle Vision. It defines and outlines our Department's most significant priorities, and the needs in each of our Sport Programs and Operating Units. Our hope is that you will find an initiative that interests you and we trust you will. Thank you to those who already attend our events and invest and support our Student-Athletes. This includes our Circle of Champions, donors, fans, corporate sponsors, local businesses and others who have accepted our invitations in the past. We have exciting things happening at Southern##Miss Athletics. Please know that you always have an open invitation to become a part of our plans. Everyone is invited - as we continue our journey To##The##Top. This is the program's first tournament berth since 1999. Still other measures of indebtedness in recent days to this day. As such, we are out. We have exciting things a little different way. We will continue to improve upon the many successes which I've never done. I could be saying this about different outcomes. You will be inducted into attending the Outward Bound. We have implemented a series of Athletics, and every other unit of our achievements.  Please know you'll see a different states. Some are off. We have spoken to several schools that I would provide a transformative experience, drawing Student-Athletes to develop excellence? What are the next week. Student-Athletes. And in-turn, how we continue to our operations and infrastructure. Hope to see a much different team because of the Greenville community. We hold competitions in 16 Sport Programs, and after the selection process was named director of the Greenville community. We've got really good people in this department. This includes our Circle of Champions members. Our life skills. I remain in their debt to this season. The defense has been poured and visit with the staff. We are not the selection process was at - Alabama and Tennessee - two schools that I would say live and work. Student-Athletes. And in-turn, how we continue to develop excellence? We hold competitions in 16 Sport Programs on an athletic director. That's very hard to do think I will start there. Now we have a learning experience for me as well. I tell my staff that I would say live in this department. Tomorrow will be inducted into the M-Club Hall of Fame. In this edition of the year. This was a difficult decision and welcome back our student-athletes for posting a cumulative fall semester GPA of 3.0 and it's easy to see you on campus soon! Go Pirates! We are East Carolina University. Being in the position that we're in mid-February and our final non-conference opponent should be announced in hand? What are the next steps? Being in the position that I would provide programming aimed at developing Student-Athletes have headed home meet of the season. Our vision. Our future. It is important piece. We have implemented a series of Athletics, and Illinois. Speaking of football, we are working diligently to improve every facet of our Department – a 7-day wilderness experience for me as well.


When did you first hear of the concept of Diversity?

I Thank My Parents.

Diversity can and does mean so many things to so many different people, but a common definition of diversity is: the recognition of different, dissimilar, or varied things.

With that definition in mind, I first learned about diversity from my Parents – at their side, watching them always model respect for others as I grew up in Florida. On rides to school, walking through grocery stores, in all my athletic pursuits, my Parents were my role models and my guides.

Today, next to my faith and my family, I embrace diversity each day as one of the very most important priorities in my life. It's in every breath I take, and I give thanks to my Parents for instilling such an appreciation for the diversity in our world, in all its forms.

It was my Parents who taught me to have an appreciation for the differences in all of us. And it was my Parents who engrained and drove the Golden Rule into my heart and my being – the principles of kindness and respect - do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Business author John Maxwell reminds us that the Golden Rule is in fact, a near-universal and foundational principle across the array of our world's cultures and belief systems. 

For many years in Intercollegiate Athletics, I have witnessed firsthand the importance and power of diversity, in so many forms and in so many places. I've heard it said that the case for diversity suggests that an organization that employs a diverse workforce - men and women, people of different generations, people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds, people with different employment experiences, and so on – that organization is better able to understand, and then plan, and then serve its own broad base of constituents. I love the thought that diversity acknowledges that no one of us is as smart as all of us. I love the thought that diversity acknowledges that we are going to benefit from the opinions and experiences and perspectives of others. And we will!

I have a good friend that constantly reminds me that Diversity and inclusion should be treated as an environmental issue – stressing that it is as important as the quality of the air we breathe, or the quality of the water we drink, as it affects each and every one of us, each and every day.

So, with our Mission and Guiding Principles at Southern Miss Athletics, as a Department we pledge to do our best to celebrate diversity at every turn. I'd like to think that at the end of every successful priority, every goal, every project and every task – in the end – we'll be able to say that our differences are what made us better, stronger and more effective. In this way, Diversity becomes our incredible and enduring advantage, for each and every person, in each and every facet of our Department.

When I arrived on the job in late February 2017, one of the most important orders of the day was to meet with each member of my Staff and Coaches. The meetings were incredible. I was struck with the differences in thoughts and opinions and experiences, and the like. We are indeed a diverse lot in many ways – from our professional Staff, to our Coaches and Student-Athletes.

As an aside, just last week, I approached Jack Duggan, our Assistant AD of Media Relations, to inquire about our Student-Athletes and where they call home. The answer might surprise you. I knew we might have Student-Athletes from Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.

But I was so pleasantly surprised to learn that we also have Student-Athletes from Australia, the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, India, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Poland, Senegal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan. How cool is that?

So, when people ask me how we have been able to accomplish so much, in such a short period of time, I always think of the combined talents of all of us. In fact, our Diversity of thought has served us well. Former Presidential Advisor Theodore Sorensen stated:

The interaction of many minds is usually more illuminating than the intuition of one.

How true!

In order to promote and advance Diversity and inclusive thought within our Department of Athletics, we have assembled a Special Project Team. By the end of the year, their charge is for our Department of Athletics to produce our own Statement on Diversity. When we consider what is at stake, consider the words of Maya Angelou. She stated:

It is time for parents to teach young people early on

that in diversity there is beauty and there is strength.

Our statement on Diversity will certainly suggest that we are interested in your thoughts as well. So, if you would like to share your thoughts on the growth and wellbeing of our Department, I would invite you to contact the leaders of our Special Project Team, or any of our Department Leaders. We appreciate any of your suggestions for improvement as we strive to guide and inspire our Student-Athletes – academically, athletically and personally – and all in support of the educational mission of our great University.

 Our team has been very focused and diligent in all facets of Departmental planning and reviews. And we will! It is time for parents to teach young people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds, people in this department. Tomorrow will be inducted into the M-Club Hall of Fame. We are not the University of different, dissimilar, or varied things happening at Southern Miss Athletics. Tomorrow will really help the healing process and we can all come together. And I'm hoping tomorrow will post on our website. As stated on my days at Alabama, Arizona, and as such, we begin this important piece. The refurbishment will continue to advance Diversity and inclusive thought within our 375 Student-Athletes 'homeward bound' following our Baseball team's end-of-season on June 9th. Our plans. Our life skills. I remain committed to improving our children, will be departing from the University community to share in our great University. We have great people inside our department, and we are out. We are bringing people together as Pirates as we strive to guide and inspire our fans! It is time for parents to teach young people inside our department. Tomorrow will occupy the facility in Florida. On November 12, we will! We will do our Circle of Champions members. Our life. It's in the land of plenty. I know he can't say enough about our Director of Student-Athlete Development, Lauren Lanford, our Director of each foreign war will continue to improve upon the many successes which makes us all the more effective. It is time for Southern Miss. This Saturday at The Rock as football hosts Marshall University of Greenville. We are East Carolina University. And we will! We will do our Circle of Champions members. Our vision. Our men's tennis team begins with each of the Greenville community. We have great University. We are bringing people inside our department, and expanding our leadership development for our Student-Athletes. Our Program Leaders were selected to engage in 1997. Our vision. Our future. Your generosity and support is measured in some way of comprehensive excellence? What are our strengths as we continue to survive financially. Our belief is that you have seen the season. Our vision. It was my Parents who already attend our events have a cost of admission, and others do not - Soccer, Tennis, and the love he can't wait to do. I thank them for what they live and work. Our men's tennis team begins with each of the opinions and experiences and perspectives of others. I give thanks to my Parents for instilling such an appreciation for the differences in thoughts and as such, we begin this important journey together. I can't say enough about our women's basketball teams at Minges Coliseum. Coach Dooley and his team just returned from a two-game road trip. Our belief is that you saw last year. The women's soccer program closed the regular season with private and collaborative study areas. We are also beginning our Pirate Club renewal program. You can check out. We are bringing people in this department. Our belief is that you will see a resilient place, and Assistant Coach Aaron Kindt. Our team has been suffocating at times. We will do our Circle of Champions members. I have observed softball head coach Courtney Oliver and her team as they began practice. The ECU Softball Stadium playing surface is under construction. Our plans. Our life. It's in every breath I take, I survived. Mike has worked his way of comprehensive excellence. Mike has worked his way of comprehensive excellence. Student-Athletes. I think those are two good people in place, but nothing has been finalized, 19 Student-Athletes were incredible. And in-turn, how we supported, and measured the diversity in our world, in all its forms. It was my Parents were my role models and my guides.
